Captive Portal
==

[A Web page used on public-access networks that require a user to view and interact with before being granted access to the public network. Captive portals are widely used by businesses that offer free Wi-Fi hotspots to Internet users. Usually a captive portal requires users to read and accept the business' acceptable use policy (AUP).](https://www.webopedia.com/TERM/C/captive_portal.html)

Many institutions use this type of authentication in the WIFI as a 'sure' means of preventing unauthorised access.
